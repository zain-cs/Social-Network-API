## 📊 Graph Data Structure Explained

This project uses a **directed graph** to model social relationships efficiently:

### Why Graph?
- **Efficient lookups:** O(1) for checking if user A follows user B
- **Path finding:** BFS algorithm for finding connections
- **Scalable:** Can handle thousands of users and connections
- **Real-world model:** Social networks are naturally graphs!

### Implementation
```python
# Adjacency List Representation
graph = {
    1: [2, 3, 5],    # User 1 follows users 2, 3, 5
    2: [1, 4],       # User 2 follows users 1, 4
    3: [1, 5],       # User 3 follows users 1, 5
    ...
}
```

### Algorithms Used
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
   - Time Complexity: O(V + E)
   - Use: Finding shortest connection path
   
2. **Set Intersection**
   - Time Complexity: O(min(n, m))
   - Use: Finding mutual connections
   
3. **Graph Traversal**
   - Time Complexity: O(V + E)
   - Use: Community size calculation

   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Open Swagger UI:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:8000/docs

3. **Register a user:**
   - Find `POST /register`
   - Click "Try it out"
   - Enter user details:
   ```json
